## Contributing Guidelines

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **üêõ Bug Fixes**: Fix issues and improve stability
- **üöÄ New Features**: Add functionality that aligns with project goals
- **üìñ Documentation**: Improve or add documentation
- **üßπ Refactoring**: Improve code quality and maintainability
- **üèéÔ∏è Performance**: Optimize existing functionality

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your idea is already being discussed
2. **Create an issue** for significant changes to discuss the approach
3. **Keep changes focused** - one feature or fix per pull request
4. **Follow the coding standards** outlined below

## Coding Standards

### Go Code Style

- **Follow Go conventions**: Use `gofmt`, `go vet`, and `golint`
- **Use meaningful names**: Variables, functions, and packages should have clear, descriptive names
- **Keep functions small**: Aim for functions that do one thing well
- **Add comments**: Document public functions and complex logic
- **Handle errors properly**: Always handle errors explicitly

### Project Structure

Follow the existing architecture:

```
internal/
 handlers/          # HTTP request handlers
 models/           # Data structures and API contracts
 repository/       # Database operations
 server/           # HTTP server configuration
 services/         # Business logic
 utils/            # Utility functions
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: Use snake_case (e.g., `file_service.go`)
- **Functions**: Use camelCase (e.g., `createDirectory`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_FILE_SIZE`)
- **Interfaces**: Use descriptive names ending with 'er' when appropriate

### Error Handling

```go
// Good
result, err := someOperation()
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to perform operation: %w", err)
}

// Avoid
result, _ := someOperation() // Never ignore errors
```

### API Design

- **Follow RESTful principles**
- **Use appropriate HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Return consistent JSON responses**
- **Include proper HTTP status codes**
- **Validate input data**

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes**

   - Write code following the coding standards
   - Add or update tests
   - Update documentation if necessary

3. **Commit your changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add amazing feature

   - Implement feature X
   - Add tests for feature X
   - Update documentation"
   ```

4. **Push to your fork**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Use a clear title and description
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Ensure CI checks pass

### Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Add file upload validation

- Implement MIME type checking
- Add file size validation
- Include tests for validation logic
- Update API documentation

Fixes #123
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23.4 or later
- SQLite3 (included)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anddsdev/cloudlet.git
   cd cloudlet
   ```

2. **Build the application**

   ```bash
   go mod download
   go build -o cloudlet ./cmd/cloudlet
   ```

3. **Run Cloudlet**
   ```bash
   ./cloudlet
   ```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8080` by default and will serve the web interface at the root path.

### Frontend Development

To run the React frontend in development mode:

1. **Navigate to the client directory**
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173` and will proxy API requests to the backend on port 8080.

4. **Build for production**

   Using Make (builds both client and backend):
   ```bash
   make build-prod
   ```

   Or build individually:
   ```bash
   make build-client  # Builds React client to web/
   make build         # Builds Go backend
   ```

   Or using npm/bun directly (client only):
   ```bash
   cd client && bun run build
   ```

The built client files are output to `web/` directory to be served by the Go backend.

### Using Docker

Build and run with Docker:
```bash
# Build Docker image (includes both client and backend)
make docker-build
# or
docker build -t cloudlet:latest .

# Run container
make docker-run
# or
docker run -d \
  --name cloudlet \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ./data:/app/data \
  cloudlet:latest
```
